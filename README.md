### Hey! I'm Michael!

Hey there! My name is Michael Graves...

I have experience working on both the frontend and backend of the development stack. I've contributed to numerous projects using Java, Python, and JavaScript, along with extensive libraries and frameworks such as Boto3, NestJS, and React. I have experience designing APIs with GraphQL and building user interfaces with ReactJS. I enjoy solving complex problems and tackling the challenges that come with processing large volumes of data.

Academically, Iâ€™ve completed both my bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s degrees in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. 

Take a look at some of my pinned projects below!
